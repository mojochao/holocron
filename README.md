## What is it?

Holocron is a Docker stack composed of services useful for the storing and 
sharing of the knowledge, tools and techniques of software developers with 
their peers.

The Holocron stack currently consists of the following services:

- readthedocs as a docs service
- devpi or warehouse as a caching Python PyPI service
- an Ansible Galaxy service
- sinopia as an internal caching npm service
- an internal caching Docker Hub service
- an nginx server proxying access to above services

## What isn't it?

Holocon is not a wiki, blog or any sort of CMS system.  It is intended for
storing and sharing final build artifacts, whether it be generated docs, code
packages, or docker images.
